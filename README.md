Used libraries and dependencies are React 18.2, React Router 6.4, React Hook Form 7.4 and Material UI 5.

## Available functionality

1. Handling user log in, log out and post fetching

## Instalation

1. Fork repo
2. Create your own Supabase project, go to SQL Editor and set up tables as follows:

```
create table
  public.users (
    uid uuid not null,
    display_name character varying not null,
    created_at timestamp without time zone null default (now() at time zone 'utc'::text),
    constraint users_pkey primary key (uid)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
create table
  public.posts (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    content character varying null,
    type character varying null,
    source character varying null,
    uid uuid null,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    constraint thoughts_pkey primary key (id),
    constraint posts_id_key unique (id),
    constraint posts_uid_fkey foreign key (uid) references users (uid)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
create table
  public.post_likes (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    uid uuid null,
    post_id bigint not null,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    constraint post_likes_pkey primary key (id),
    constraint post_likes_post_id_fkey foreign key (post_id) references posts (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

3. In Supabase, go to Authentication tab, then in Policies create new policies for table actions:

```
create policy "Profiles are viewable by everyone."
  on users for select
  using ( true );

create policy "Users can insert their own profile."
  on users for insert
  with check ( auth.uid() = id );

create policy "Users can update own profile."
  on users for update
  using ( auth.uid() = id );

create policy "Posts are viewable by everyone."
  on posts for select
  using ( true );

create policy "Post likes are viewable by everyone."
  on post_likes for select
  using ( true );
```

4. Create a test user for tests assertion (Authentication tab in Supabase)
5. Execute `npm i` to install dependencies
6. You need to create `.env` file with these variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=supabase_key
VITE_SUPABASE_SITE=supabase_site
VITE_SUPABASE_TEST_EMAIL=test@user.com
VITE_SUPABASE_TEST_PASSWORD=123
```

7. Execute `npm run test` to start tests to check all functionality.
